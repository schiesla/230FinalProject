User Story:
Colorado is a very hard state to navigate with the Rocky Mountains running right through the state. This also proves to be a good thing as the mountains provide ample amounts of entertainment whether it be state parks, ski resorts, or just historic areas. With that being said, we would like to have an app that simplifies routes to and from our favorite places in the state, whether it be a city or an attraction. We would also like to be able to list all these places and see their ratings with ease. We would like this app to run fast and supply us with the quickest possible route to our favorite places.
